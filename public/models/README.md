# 3D Models Directory

Place your 3D model files (`.glb`, `.gltf`) in this directory.

## Required Models:
- `ai-brain.glb` - A 3D model of an AI brain or neural network visualization
- Any other models you want to showcase

## Model Requirements:
1. Use `.glb` format for best compatibility
2. Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB if possible)
3. Optimize models for web viewing
4. Include appropriate textures and materials
5. Test models in the model-viewer before deployment
